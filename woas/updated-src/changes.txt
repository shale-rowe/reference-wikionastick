= woas_0_11_1.htm

*Using my css settings.* Mostly this is just a change to place TOC on right hand and use left justified text. Not content with my changes (especially text box width) but OK for now.

= aes.js

*Modularized code* to hide everything but the AES api from the global namespace.

*Added isKeySet()* to API so that private key is untouchable.

= i18n.js

*Added CONFIRM_REMOVE_ENCRYPT* for the encryption confirm prompt

*Changed LOCK_CONFIRM[_LATEST] to CONFIRM_LOCK[_LATEST]* for consistency with other confirm strings.

*Made use of quotes consistent* across all the strings.

*Sorted strings* to make them easier to find.

=stickwiki.js

*Changed LOCK_CONFIRM* to match new name.

*Moved remove encrypt prompt* to i18n.js: CONFIRM_REMOVE_ENCRYPT

*Changed AES.key.length to AES.isKeySet()* to match AES API.

= wsif.js

*woas._native_page_def:* If attrs not defined function returns bpos_e+boundary.length. bpos_e has not been set. Fix: moved boundary finding code to private function so true value is returned. Other very minor changes in this function for readability.

*_native_wsif_load:* Minor rearrangements for readability. This also obviated need for was_title var.
