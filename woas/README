= Wiki on a Stick

Wiki on a Stick (WoaS) is a personal wiki that lives in one self-modifying
XHTML containing software, interface and data. Very useful for creating small
websites and mantaining notes or todo-lists; completely javascript-
programmable, supports images and files embedding.

= Installation instructions

WoaS needs a modern javascript-capable browser, currently supported browsers
are:

- Mozilla Firefox (Gecko-based, all versions)
- Internet Explorer (6.0 and above)
- Google Chrome, Opera and Safari (AppleWebkit-based)

You can't use WoaS with javascript disabled; also you will need java applets
to exploit file loading/saving features on AppleWebkit-based browsers.

TiddlySaver.jar is the java applet used in such cases (borrowed from
TiddlyWiki project); if you do not need TiddlySaver.jar feature, you can remove
it.

The plugins directory contains user-contributed plugins which are more or less actively mantained.

In order to start WoaS, open the woas-*.html file, which contains the software
and the default pages.

= WoaS usage

WoaS contains all the necessary documentation in its help pages.

= Removal instructions

Delete woas-*.html and TiddlySaver.jar (if present).
