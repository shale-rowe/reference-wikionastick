I am in the middle of recreating my sources.

The code in woas/src is an up-to-date (when it was committed), carefully checked dot notation conversion of the trunk/woas/src code

The code in woas/src-fix is just a copy of the above. I have not committed the changes yet, but will do so next time I have computer time. Sorry for the inconvenience -- but I think/hope I'm getting the hang of SVN now.
