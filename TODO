== 0.12.x development goals

* use Java on IE for binary operations

* optimize file splitting after reading from Java (without TiddlySaver)

* find how to use direct Java for binary operations on Presto/Webkit

* load binary files through TiddlySaver

* fix rendering of Special::Embed:: pages

* 'display full file' doesn't work

* file preview should be wrapped correctly

* inclusion link examples should not be parsed in File:: or Image:: pages

* disallow all XHTML tags also in plugins source code (when inline) (to prevent ILLEGAL_TOKEN error on Webkit browsers)

* disallow opening/saving to empty string paths

* shall delete plugins when erasing?

* last search item in serach results list not wiki-parsed to be <li/>

* have all <input type="button" /> use the same class

* possibly allow macro calls without trailing ':' when no macro text needs to be specified

* fix template examples in help pages (deleted when erasing wiki)

* allow registration of plugin deletion events

* allow UI customization at runtime
** will use markers for each block of code in <body/>, e.g. like already done for <head/>

* import preview

* check why Opera 10.53 (Windows) does not get a TiddlySaver applet definition

* deprecate Special:: namespace in favor of WoaS:: namespace (where possible)

* attempt to use XHR to load files (not always a good idea: think about server scripts)

* code documentation and modularization

* have a page object for each page
** this will optimize read operations because page objects will be passed by reference

* finish implementation of WSIF datasource locking

* XHTML compliance
** rendering
** export

* group operations on page lists (deletion, encryption, decryption etc.) maybe also with checkboxes
** needs to be finished

* icon themes (importing and changing of default graphics)
** all icons should go into pages
*** images/files without specific namespace

* remember export settings
