WHILE FIX & WIP ARE BEING UPDATED/MERGED THIS CODE MAY NOT BE WORKING AS FOUND.
IT IS NOT BEING TESTED MUCH DURING THIS PROCESS AND COULD OCCASIONALLY BE BROKEN.

I am near to having a finished, fixed 0.12.0. to upload. I simply don't have the time to commit changes piece by piece. If anyone really wants to see it later I'll consider sending them my git development repository (what a mess!)
