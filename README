= Wiki on a Stick

Wiki on a Stick (WoaS) is a personal wiki that lives in one self-modifying
XHTML containing software, interface and data. Very useful for creating small
websites and mantaining notes or todo-lists; completely javascript-
programmable, supports images and files embedding.

= Installation instructions

WoaS needs a modern javascript-capable browser, currently supported browsers
are:

- Mozilla Firefox (Gecko-based, all versions)
- Internet Explorer (6.0 and above)
- Google Chrome, Opera and Safari (AppleWebkit-based)

You can't use WoaS with javascript disabled; also you will need java applets
to exploit file loading/saving features on AppleWebkit-based browsers.

TiddlySaver.jar is the java applet used in such cases (borrowed from
TiddlyWiki project).

In order to start WoaS, open the woas.htm file, which contains the software
and the default pages.

= WoaS usage

WoaS contains all the necessary documentation in its help pages.

= Removal instructions

Delete woas.htm and TiddlySaver.jar.
