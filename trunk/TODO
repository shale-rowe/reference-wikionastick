== 0.12.x development goals

* apply version conversions on all imports (by checking version in WSIF)

* check mime type of images which might have got 'undefined' mime type

* allow registration of plugin deletion events

* allow UI customization at runtime
** will use markers for each block of code in <body/>, e.g. like already done for <head/>

* import preview

* check why Opera 10.53 (Windows) does not get a TiddlySaver applet definition

* deprecate Special:: namespace in favor of WoaS:: namespace (where possible)

* attempt to use XHR to load files (not always a good idea: think about server scripts)

* code documentation and modularization

* have a page object for each page
** this will optimize read operations because page objects will be passed by reference

* finish implementation of WSIF datasource locking

* XHTML compliance
** rendering
** export

* group operations on page lists (deletion, encryption, decryption etc.) maybe also with checkboxes
** needs to be finished

* icon themes (importing and changing of default graphics)
** all icons should go into pages
*** images/files without specific namespace

* remember export settings
