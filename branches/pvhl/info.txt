The only code being worked on is in the fix directory. I am finishing up a version to be left with this project, but have started a 'Woas Legacy' fork project that will use my updated/fixed code and remain essentially compatible with WoaS 0.12.0, and a new 'Woas' project that will eventually create a completely new version with advanced capabilities.

You can read some of my reasons for doing this here: http://sourceforge.net/p/woas/blog/2011/09/welcome-332/

Thanks, Paul.
