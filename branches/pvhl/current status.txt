I am using this repository to maintain fixes I have made to WoaS 0.12.0 
and also any enhancements/changes I have made to how WoaS works. The 
fixes are in the subdirectory "fix" and enhancements are in "enhance". 
The changes in "fix" will likely be absorbed into the official trunk 
code, the changes in "enhance" will likely not become official as they 
mostly likely change some basic aspect of WoaS operation. This might be 
a change in how parsing works or some backwards- incompatible change. 

Right now I am working on fixing some important, basic bugs in WoaS 
operation. My current plan is to then finish work on defining what I 
would like to see in a tool of this sort and start work on building it. 
I am likely to pursue this further work in a separate project as my 
needs are perhaps not quite aligned with those of WoaS. I have struggled 
with this for a while as I like WoaS and don't want to fork the project. 
My new project will reuse as much code as possible from WoaS, but will 
have a different basic design and probably not use the wsif format 
natively. 

I will also make updated single-file versions of these branches 
available in this directory. The file will be the latest, tested 
version, and will overwrite the previous one; if you need a specific 
version you can retrieve it from SVN. I will also tag the main code if 
it seems necessary. 

* fix - latest code for testing and use (probably also tagged)
* fix-wip - work-in-progress; may not be usable ... my current commit
* enhance - latest code for testing and use (probably also tagged)
* enhance-wip - work-in-progress; may not be usable ... my current commit 

I hope this work will be of use. Due to limited time available I will 
not be able to provide support on this, but let me know if there are 
issues (especially specific to my versions) and I will do my best to fix 
them.
