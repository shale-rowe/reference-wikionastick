I am in the middle of recreating my sources.

The code in woas/src has been removed as everything is now merged with trunk by Daniele.

The code in woas/src-fix is updated, but there are still a few little changes to make to get (non-strict) jslint-type warnings to go away.

There are some minor changes to wsif.js, stickwiki.js just for code validation. I just have a few more to add and then I will work on additions and/or bug fixes.
