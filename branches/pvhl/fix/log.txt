WHILE THE CODE IN 'FIX' IS BEING UPDATED/MERGED IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE WORKING AS FOUND.
IT IS NOT BEING TESTED MUCH DURING THIS PROCESS AND COULD OCCASIONALLY BE BROKEN.

That said, I'm actually trying to make sure that only working 'fix' code is uploaded, especially for the woas-fix[.min].html files; these will not always be the same as the multi-file code for that reason.

I am near to having a finished, fixed 0.12.0. to upload. I simply don't have the time to commit changes piece by piece. If anyone really wants to see it later I'll consider sending them my git development repository (what a mess!)
