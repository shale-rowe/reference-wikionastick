You need to download pvhlWoas.htm into a directory that contains
an index.wsif file. If it cannot find the index file it won't work.
If you don't have one use the one at:
    http://stickwiki.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/stickwiki/trunk/woas/

This file loads the javascript code from Sourceforge, so you are always
testing the latest code from my updated-src directory. This is very
helpful to me, but please only use it for testing.

Later I will add a wsif file that discusses what I am doing, etc.
I would like you to be able to provide feedback.

Right now the changes are minimal other than changing the code to dot
format. The css also uses a right hand TOC but that's about it, except
for a bug fix or two.

The main point right now is to prove that it works as well as the
official code, so any feedback is welcome (you can email my sourceforge
account if you like).

This hasn't fixed the problems that are in the official code. I am
having a lot of problems right now with the back/forward buttons, but
this is true of the official 0.11.1 for me also. I haven't had time to
look into it yet.

Thanks. Paul Levey.
