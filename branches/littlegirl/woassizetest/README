This is a collection of WoaS 0.11.1 WSIF files of varying sizes as sort of a stress test of the wiki. There are currently four files, and more will be added as time permits.

* Each file contains a different number of pages.
* Each page is 50 paragraphs, has 5696 words, is 37.6 KB, and is 10 pages long if pasted into OpenOffice word processor.
* The pages are numbered sequentially.
* The file name tells how many stress test pages the wiki contains, how many words are in the pages, and how large the wiki is with those pages in it.

To use these files, import them into a fresh copy of WoaS 0.11.1 with Special::ImportWSIF.
