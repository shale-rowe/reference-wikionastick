These themes will overwrite everything in the [[WoaS::CSS::Custom]] page. Before using them, back up anything you have on that page so you can add it back into the page after applying the theme.

Use:

1) Click the Advanced icon in the navigation bar.

2) Click the Special::ImportWSIF link in the Maintenance section of the page.

3) Use the radio button to select Overwrite in the Existing pages section.

4) Make sure the box next to "Import pages of the WoaS:: namespace (hotkeys, plugins, aliases and custom CSS)" is checked.

5) Click the Browse... button and browse to the theme file you downloaded.

6) Click the Open button (or the OK button or whatever your browser offers) to select the file and return to the wiki.

7) Click the ImportWSIF button.
