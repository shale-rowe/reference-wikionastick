Book on a Stick is a single file application that can run on many browsers. Certain browsers require a Java applet to take full advantage of the loading and saving features in the wiki:

* Apple Webkit-based browsers (like Safari).
* Opera

The TiddlySaver.jar file (borrowed from the TiddlyWiki project) is the Java applet used in such cases. See the [[Wiki::Help::Requirements]] page inside the wiki for instructions on how to use it.
