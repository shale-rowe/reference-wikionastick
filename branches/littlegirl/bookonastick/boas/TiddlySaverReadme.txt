Book on a Stick is a single file application that can run on JavaScript-capable browsers. Currently supported browsers are:

* Chrome (Apple Webkit-based)
* Firefox (Gecko-based, all versions)
* Internet Explorer (6.0 and above)
* Opera
* Safari (Apple Webkit-based)

Certain browsers require a Java applet to take full advantage of the loading and saving features in the wiki:

* Chrome
* Opera
* Safari

The TiddlySaver.jar file (borrowed from the TiddlyWiki project) is the Java applet used for this purpose, and is included in the download file. See the [[Wiki::Help::Requirements]] page inside the wiki for instructions on how to use it.
